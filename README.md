Path finder for OSRS f2p

May run slowly on bad machines. Eh.

Go to https://muffyn.github.io/

Click to start a path, click again to find the distance. Click on an unpathable tile like a tree to reset your start point. Length of path is shown in console (F12). Set `showFullSearch=true` to see what the algorithm is doing kinda.
